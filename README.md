# kt - a Kafka tool that likes JSON [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgeller/kt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgeller/kt)

Some reasons why you might be interested:

* Consume messages on specific partitions between specific offsets.
* Display topic information (e.g., with partition offset and leader info).
* Modify consumer group offsets (e.g., resetting or manually setting offsets per topic and per partition).
* JSON output for easy consumption with tools like [kp](https://github.com/echojc/kp) or [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
* JSON input to facilitate automation via tools like [jsonify](https://github.com/fgeller/jsonify).
* Configure brokers, topic, Kafka version and authentication via environment variables `KT_BROKERS`, `KT_TOPIC`, `KT_KAFKA_VERSION` and `KT_AUTH`.
* Fast start up time.
* No buffering of output.
* Binary keys and payloads can be passed and presented in base64 or hex encoding.
* Support for TLS authentication.
* Basic cluster admin functions: Create & delete topics.

I'm not using kt actively myself anymore, so if you think it's lacking some feature - please let me know by creating an issue!

## Examples

### Docker

[@Paxa](https://github.com/Paxa) maintains an image to run kt in a Docker environment - thanks!

For more information: [https://github.com/Paxa/kt](https://github.com/Paxa/kt)

## Usage:

    $ kt -help
    kt is a tool for Kafka.

    Usage:

            kt command [arguments]

    The commands are:

            consume        consume messages.
            produce        produce messages.
            topic          topic information.
            group          consumer group information and modification.
            admin          basic cluster administration.

    Use "kt [command] -help" for for information about the command.

    Authentication:

    Authentication with Kafka can be configured via a JSON file.
    You can set the file name via an "-auth" flag to each command or
    set it via the environment variable KT_AUTH.

## Authentication / Encryption

Authentication configuration is possibly via a JSON file. You indicate the mode
of authentication you need and provide additional information as required for
your mode. You pass the path to your configuration file via the `-auth` flag to
each command individually, or set it via the environment variable `KT_AUTH`.

### TLS

Required fields:

 - `mode`: This needs to be set to `TLS`
 - `client-certificate`: Path to your certificate
 - `client-certificate-key`: Path to your certificate key
 - `ca-certificate`: Path to your CA certificate

Example for an authorization configuration that is used for the system tests:


    {
        "mode": "TLS",
        "client-certificate": "test-secrets/kt-test.crt",
        "client-certificate-key": "test-secrets/kt-test.key",
        "ca-certificate": "test-secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt"
    }

### TLS one-way

Required fields:

 - `mode`: This needs to be set to `TLS-1way`

Optional fields:

 - `ca-certificate`: Path to your CA certificate


Example:


    {
        "mode": "TLS-1way"
    }

### Other modes

Please create an
[issue](https://github.com/fgeller/kt/issues/new) with details for the mode that you need.
